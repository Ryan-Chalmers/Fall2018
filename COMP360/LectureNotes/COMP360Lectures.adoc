== Algorithm Design and Analysis

* Completeness and NP-Completeness: how do we tell if a problem is hard or easy
ie whether or not there is some fast algorithm for it
* Linear Programming
* How to Handle hard problems
* Two Important Algorithms: Jpeg compression and Google Pagerank

=== NP-Completeness

==== Fast vs Slow

* *FAST* an algorithm runs in polynomial time if for some _d_, for every
input instance of size r it runs in O(n~d~) time
* Note whether we say that the size of an input integer _s_ is s or log s,
makes a difference if algorithms are fast or slow

==== Hard vs Easy

* A problem is easy if it is fast ie. polynomial time, algorithm solves it
* If a problem is not easy it is hard

=== Decision Problems

* A problem where the output is yes or no
* Many problems have a corresponding decision problem such that either both are
hard or both are easy

==== Certificates

* A decision problem is yes-certifiable if for every instance for which the
answer is yes, we can associate a certificate such that there is an algorithm
which given the certificate can determine if the answer is yes in polynomial
time
* A decision problem is no-certifiable if for every instance for which the
answer is no, we can associate a certificate such that there is an algorithm
which given the certificate can determine if the answer is yes in polynomial
time

==== Possibly Easy Problem

* If a decision problem is easy then it must be both yes-certifiable and
no-certifiable
** because we can just ignore the certificate and use the fast
algorithm which solves it

=== Using Reductions to Quickly Solve Problems

* A reduction algorithm from decision problem π to π' takes input π and yields
π' with the same answer
* If there is a fast reduction from π to π' and a fast algorithm for π' then
there is a fast algorithm for π
* Implies if there is a fast reduction from π to π' and no fast algorithm
for π then there is no fast algorithm for π'
* We can use reduction from hard problem to π', to show π' is hard

=== Linear Programming

* Minimizing or maximizing a linear function subject to a finite number of
linear constraints
* Standard Form
** Maximize: +
_∑^n^~j=1~c~j~x~j~_
** Subject to: +
_∑^n^~j=1~a~ij~x~j~ <= b~i~ (i=1,2,3...,m)_ +
_x~j~ >= 0 (j=1,2,3,...,n)_

* Objective Function: the linear function that is to be minimized or maximized
in an LP
* Optimal solution: the feasible solution that maximizes the objective function

==


* Reducing from other problems to linear problems
* Integer Linear Program = Linear Program + all variables integers

=== The Diet Problem

* six variables, # of servings of each food, x1, ..., x6
* minimize price: 3x1 + 24x2 + 13x3 + 9x4 + 20x5 + 19x6
* >= 2000 c, >= 55g protein, >= 800mg calcium
* x1, ..., x6 >= 0
