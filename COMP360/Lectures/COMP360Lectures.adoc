* *FAST* an algorithm runs in polynomial time if for some _d_, for every
input instance of size r it runs in O(n~d~) time

== Linear Programming

* Reducing from other problems to linear problems
* Integer Linear Program = Linear Program + all variables integers

=== The Diet Problem

* six variables, # of servings of each food, x1, ..., x6
* minimize price: 3x1 + 24x2 + 13x3 + 9x4 + 20x5 + 19x6
* >= 2000 c, >= 55g protein, >= 800mg calcium
* x1, ..., x6 >= 0
