= Assignment 4

== Question 1

* First we want to sort the input, we get: 2,6,7,11,16,17,22,23,33,44,54,56,66,107
* Then we want to solve using the formula given in lecture: p(a~i~, a~j~) = 2/(j-i)
* We can map each integers (17, 44) to numbers in the following way: i=5+1=6, j = 9
* Using the formula from class: p(a~i~, a~j~) = 2/5

== Question 2

* From the question we can produce an approximation by using cutting patterns of
uniform widths.
* Once the algorithm has been run, any cutting pattern that is less than half
full we can combine with another less than half full to produce cutting patterns
that are at least half full. Except for one in some occasions. This produces
at most k/2 cutting patterns of mixed widths.
* We know that all rows are at least half full (except possibly one) because
any roll that is less than half full can be continually combine with other
rolls that are less than half full until that roll is at least half full.
* Next we want to look at an optimal solution the original problem,
since we are looking for a lower bound on the approximation we will choose
and optimal solution where each of the raw rolls are completely full with
cutting patterns.
* Looking at this solution we can determine that a solution using twice the
number of raw rolls can be satisfied if each roll is half full with cutting
patterns.
* If we look at our solution using the approximation algorithm we see that
since each final roll is at least full we have found a two approximation.

== Question 3

* Given the solution to the fractional relaxation of the optimal solution we can
 calculate the number of rolls necessary by summing all of the x~i~s.
* We are trying to find a solution within Â± k/2 of the fractional solution
that is an integer solution.
* To find this we look at each of the individual x~i~s, and do one of the
following options
* let _l~i~ = x~i~ - floor(x~i~)_
** if _l~i~_ > 1/2 then: we want to simply round up the x~i~s, this
gives at most k/2 since -- _sum~k~(l~i~) < k/2, if: l~i~ > (1/2)_
** if _l~i~_ < 1/2 then: we do as we did in question three, we want to continuously
join the l~i~s until we have a roll that is full greater than a half, and from the
previous question we know that this can not sum to greater than k/2 cutting patterns
of mixed width

== Question 4

* The solution is i=j and x = w-w~j~
* This is the solution because in the algorithm we want to set a cell to true if
it can be chosen to fill the backpack, and we want to adapt the algorithm for
the normal knapsack to a multi knapsack.
* To achieve this we must look to see in the current column, if the previous
multiple is set to true for the current weight we are looking at. If it is
set to true, then we can set the new multiple of the current weight to true and
then we will set the value appropriately.
