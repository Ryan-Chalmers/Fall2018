== Intro to Software Quality Assurance

=== Definitions

* mistake: people commit errors
* defect: a mistake can lead to defect
* failure: occurs when defect executes
* incident: consequence of failures-failure occurrence may or may not be apparent
to user

=== Nine Causes of Software Defects

1. Faulty requirements definitions
2. Client-developer communication
3. Deliberate deviations from software requirements
4. Logical design errors
5. Coding errors
6. non-compliance with documentation and coding instructions
7. Shortcomings of the testing process
8. Procedure errors
9. Documentation errors

//Todo: add tree figure

* Correctness
* Reliability
** First failure
** Max failure rate

* Efficiency
* Integrity
* UX
* Maintainability
** Effort to identify and fix errors

* Flexibility
* Testability
** Support for testing, traceability

* Portability
** Adaptation to other environments

* Reusability
** Use of software components for other projects

* Interoperability
** Ability to interface with other components/systems

=== SQA

==== Three key principles

1. know what you are doing
* what is being built, how its being built, what it does
* Management structure
* Reporting Policies
* Tracking

2. know what you should be doing
* Having explicit requirements and specifications
* Requirements analysis
* Acceptance tests
* User feedback

3. know how to measure the difference
* Measure comparing what is being done with what should be done
* Includes:
** Formal methods
** Testing
** Inspections
** Metrics
