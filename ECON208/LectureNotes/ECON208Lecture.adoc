= ECON 208

== Chapter 1

=== What is Economics

* Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources to satisfy unlimited
human wants

* Resources: land, labour, resource
** referred to as factors of production
** Outputs: goods, or services

==== Scarcity and Choice

* Scarcity indicates having to make a choice
* For every choice made there is an opportunity cost (whatre you giving up to
produce these resources)
* *Opportunity Cost* the value of the next best alternative that is forgone
when one alternative is chosen

//TODO: add  graph pizza/beer opportunity cost graph

* Production Possibility Boundary (PPB)
** Illustrates
*** Scarcity
*** Choice
*** Opportunity Cost

** Items on boundary are most efficient, using all resources possible

//TODO: add PPB graph

* Opportunity cost for activity includes three things:
1. The direct cost of activity, plus
2. Whatever you give up in order to do the activity, minus
3. Whatever savings the activity generates

==== Four Key Economic Problems

1. What is produces and how?
* *Resource allocation* determines the quantities of various goods that are
produced

2. What is consumed and by whom?

4. Is productive capacity growing?

//TODO: the effect of economic growth on PPB

==== Economics and Government

* Can tax
* Alter allocation of resources
* Improve distribution of consumption
* Can affect the overall output and income

=== The Complexity of Modern Economics

==== Nature of the Economy

* *Many transactions* leads to a *complex* system that is *self-organized*
* Self organizing: individual consumers and producers seek to maximize
their own satisfaction which leads to the overall state of the economy
* Incentives and self-interest:
** everyone is selfish
** individuals respond to incentive

* Efficiency: will we produce the goods and services people want using the
least possible resources

=== The Decision Makers and Their Choices

* Consumers: maximizes satisfaction/utility with budget constraint
* Producers: maximized profits
* Government

//TODO: the circular flow of income and expenditure figure

=== Production and Trade

* displays two characteristics
** specialization of labour
** division of labour

* specialization: allocation of jobs to different people
** Advantageous because
*** individual abilities differ - comparative advantage

* Division of labour: the breaking up of a production process into a series of
specific tasks

== Economic Theories, Data, and Graphs

=== Positive and Normative Statements

* *Normative Statement* depend on value judgements and opinions - cannot
be settled by resource facts
* *Positive Statements* do not involve value judgements, they are statements
about what is, was, or will be

=== Building and Testing Economic Theories

* Theories
** Variables
*** Endogenous
*** Exogenous

** Assumptions
*** motives
*** Causation
*** Applicability
*** Unrealistic

** Predictions

== Demand Supply and Price

=== Demand

* Quantity demanded: the total amount consumers desire to purchase at in some
period
* _ceteris paribus_: the price of a product and the quantity demanded are
negatively related

* A change in variables other than price will shift the demand curve
  - average household income
  - prices of other products

- Shifts in the Demand curve
  - rightward: increase in demand
  - leftward: decrease in demand

- A *change in demand* is a change in the quantitiy demanded at every price
shift the entire curve
- A *change in quantity demanded* refers to a movement from one point on a
demand curve to another point

=== Supply

* Quantity supply: the amount of product that a firm desires to sell in some
time period
* Shifts in supply curve:
  - increase price of inputs
  - technology government taxes and subsidies
- A *change in supply* is a shift of the entire curve
- A *change in quantity supplied*: same as demand
