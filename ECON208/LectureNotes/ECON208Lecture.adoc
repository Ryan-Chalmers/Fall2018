== 1.

=== What is Economics

* Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources to satisfy unlimited
human wants

* Resources: land, labour, resource
** referred to as factors of production
** Outputs: goods, or services

==== Scarcity and Choice

* Scarcity indicates having to make a choice
* For every choice made there is an opportunity cost (whatre you giving up to
produce these resources)
* *Opportunity Cost* the value of the next best alternative that is forgone
when one alternative is chosen

//TODO: add  graph pizza/beer opportunity cost graph

* Production Possibility Boundary (PPB)
** Illustrates
*** Scarcity
*** Choice
*** Opportunity Cost

** Items on boundary are most efficient, using all resources possible

//TODO: add PPB graph

* Opportunity cost for activity includes three things:
1. The direct cost of activity, plus
2. Whatever you give up in order to do the activity, minus
3. Whatever savings the activity generates

==== Four Key Economic Problems

1. What is produces and how?
* *Resource allocation* determines the quantities of various goods that are
produced

2. What is consumed and by whom?

4. Is productive capacity growing?

//TODO: the effect of economic growth on PPB

==== Economics and Government

* Can tax
* Alter allocation of resources
* Improve distribution of consumption
* Can affect the overall output and income

=== The Complexity of Modern Economics

==== Nature of the Economy

* *Many transactions* leads to a *complex* system that is *self-organized*
* Self organizing: individual consumers and producers seek to maximize
their own satisfaction which leads to the overall state of the economy
* Incentives and self-interest:
** everyone is selfish
** individuals respond to incentive

* Efficiency: will we produce the goods and services people want using the
least possible resources

=== The Decision Makers and Their Choices

* Consumers: maximizes satisfaction/utility with budget constraint
* Producers: maximized profits
* Government

//TODO: the circular flow of income and expenditure figure

=== Production and Trade

* displays two characteristics
** specialization of labour
** division of labour

* specialization: allocation of jobs to different people
** Advantageous because
*** individual abilities differ - comparative advantage

* Division of labour: the breaking up of a production process into a series of
specific tasks

== 2. Economic Theories, Data, and Graphs

=== Positive and Normative Statements

* *Normative Statement* depend on value judgements and opinions - cannot
be settled by resource facts
* *Positive Statements* do not involve value judgements, they are statements
about what is, was, or will be

=== Building and Testing Economic Theories

* Theories
** Variables
*** Endogenous
*** Exogenous

** Assumptions
*** motives
*** Causation
*** Applicability
*** Unrealistic

** Predictions

=== Graphing Economic Theories

== 3. Demand Supply and Price

=== Demand

* Quantity demanded: the total amount consumers desire to purchase in some time
period
* _ceteris paribus_: the price of a product and the quantity demanded are
*negatively* related

image::images/2018/09/demandcurve.png[demand curve]

* A change in variables other than price will shift the demand curve
  - average household income
  - prices of other products

- Shifts in the Demand curve
  - rightward: increase in demand
  - leftward: decrease in demand

- A *change in demand* is a change in the quantity demanded at every price
shift the entire curve
- A *change in quantity demanded* refers to a movement from one point on a
demand curve to another point

image::images/2018/09/increase-of-demand.png[increase of demand]

=== Supply

* Quantity supply: the amount of product that a firm desires to sell in some
time period
* _ceteris paribus_: the price of a product and the quantity demanded are
*positively* related
* Shifts in supply curve:
  - increase price of inputs
  - technology government taxes and subsidies
* Quantity supplied it the amount that firms are willing to offer for sale and
not necessarily the quantity sold
- A *change in supply* is a shift of the entire curve
- A *change in quantity supplied*: refers to a movement from one point on a
supply curve to another point

=== The Determination of Price

* *Market* a market may be defined as any situation in which buyers and sellers
negotiate the transaction of some goods and services
* *Perfectly competitive market* buyers and sellers are price takers

==== Changes in Market Prices

* Four "laws" of supply and demand
1. An increase in demand causes an increase in both equilibrium price and
equilibrium quantity
2. A decrease in demand demand causes a decrease in both equilibrium price and
equilibrium quantity

.Shifts in the demand curve
image::images/ECON208Lecture-66915.png[align=center]

3. An increase in supply causes a decrease in the equilibrium price and in
increase in the equilibrium quantity
4. A decrease in supply causes an increase in the equilibrium price and a
decrease in the equilibrium quantity

.Shifts in the supply curve

=== Relative Prices and Inflation

* The *absolute price* of a product is the amount of money that must be spent
to acquire one unit of that price
* A *relative price* is the price of one good in terms of another
* Demand and supply curves are drawn in terms of relative prices rather than
absolute prices

== 4. Elasticity

=== Price Elasticity of Demand

* Demand is *elastic* when quantity demanded is very responsive to change
in the products own price (*inelastic* is opposite)
* Related to the slope of the demand curve but not the same

.Elastic demand
image::images/ECON208Lecture-7a8e3.png[align=center]

.inelastic demand
image::images/ECON208Lecture-92ebe.png[align=center]

* *Note* we can only do visual comparison if: both the curves are drawn on the
same scale
* We start from the same price-quantity equilibrium

==== The Measurement of Price Elasticity

* Elasticity is defined as

image::images/ECON208Lecture-e3de9.png[align=center]

* Demand elasticity is *negative*, but economists usually use the
*absolute value*
* Elasticity measures the change in p and Q relative to some base values of
p and Q

.Example: from point 0 to 1
image::images/ECON208Lecture-18dc3.png[align=center]

.Elasticity along a linear demand curve
image::images/ECON208Lecture-f468b.png[align=center]

.Demand Curves with constant elasticity
image::images/ECON208Lecture-0d509.png[align=center]

* D~1~ is perfectly inelastic
* D~2~ is perfectly elastic at p~0~
* D~3~ is unit elastic: a given % increase in p induces an equal % decrease
in q at all points on the curve

==== What Determines Elasticity of Demand

* Demand elasticity tends to be high when there are many *close substitutes*
* The availability of substitutes is determined by:
** the length of the time interval considered
** whether the good is a necessity or a luxury
** how specifically the product is defined

==== Total Expenditure

* The change in total expenditure depends on the relative changes in price and
quantity: +
_Total Expenditure = Price X Quantity_
* Elasticity > 1: Changes in price cause TE to change in opposite direction
* Elasticity < 1: Changes in price cause TE to change in the same direction
* TE reaches maximum when demand is *unit elastic*

=== Price Elasticity of Supply

* Price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of the quantity
supplied to a change in the products own price
* it is denoted as _n_~s~ and is defined as:

image::images/ECON208Lecture-8ff68.png[align=center]

==== Determinants of Supply Elasticity

* The elasticity of supply depends on how easily firms can increase
output in response to an increase in the product's price
* Depends on:
** The technical ease of substitution
** The nature of production costs
** The time span under consideration

* Are resource inputs really available
* Are factors mobile, ie can workers move when needed
* Can finished products be easily stored
* etc...

image::images/ECON208Lecture-1027d.png[align=center]

==== Important Example of Where Elasticity Matters

* *Exice Tax*: A tax on the sale of a particular commodity
* *Tax Incidence* Who bears the burden of the tax?

.The effect of a cigarette exice tax
image::images/ECON208Lecture-79e2a.png[align=center]

.The effect of a cigarette on exice tax 2.0
image::images/ECON208Lecture-2eeef.png[align=center]

* The burden of an exice tax is independent of who actually remits the tax to
the government - it depends only on relative *elasticities* of demand and
supply
* More inelastic is demand, more burden for consumers

=== Other Demand Elasticities

==== Income Elasticity of Demand

image::images/ECON208Lecture-3ee63.png[align=center]

===== Luxuries Versus Necessities

* The more necessary an item is in the consumption pattern of consumers, the
lower its income elasticity
* Income elasticities for any one product also vary with the level of a
consumer's income
* The distinction between luxuries and necessities also helps to explain
differences in income elasticities between countries

==== Cross Elasticity of Demand

image::images/ECON208Lecture-26485.png[align=center]

== 5. Price Controls and Market Efficiency

=== Government-Controlled Prices

==== Disequilibrium Prices

* At any disequilibrium price, quantity exchanged is determined by the lesser
of quantity demanded or quantity supplied

* If price is set above equilibrium, some sellers will be unable to find buyers
* Conversely, if price is set below equilibrium, some buyers will be unable to
find sellers
* With administered prices, the quantity is determined by the *lesser* of
quantity demanded and supplied
* *Partial Equilibrium* is the analysis of a single market in which the feedback
effects from the market are ignored

.The determination of quantity exchanged in disequilibrium
image::images/ECON208Lecture-c2051.png[align=center]

==== Price Floors

.A binding price floor
image::images/ECON208Lecture-c2051.png[align=center]

* Price floors make it illegal to sell the product below the controlled price
* Price floors lead to excess supply

==== Price Ceilings

.A price ceiling and Black-Market pricing
image::images/ECON208Lecture-20e1f.png[align=center]

* A price ceiling is the maximum price at which a product may be exchanged
* Price ceilings lead to excess demand
* Reasons for excess demand:
** Restrict production
** Keep specific prices down
** satisfy (normative) notions of quantity

=== Rent Controls: A case study of Price Ceilings

* The predicted effects of rent controls
** Binding rent controls are a specific form of price ceiling

.Short-run and long-run effects of rent controls
image::images/ECON208Lecture-ecb12.png[align=center]

* Existing tenants in rent-controlled apartments win
* Landlords lose
* Potential future tenants also suffer

==== Policy Alternatives

* Housing shortages can be reduced if the government (at taxpayers' expense)
either subsidizes housing production or produces public housing directly
* The government may also provide lower-income households with income assistance
* But no policy is "free" every policy involves resources cost

=== An Introduction to Market Efficiency

* Legislated minimum wages make firms and some workers worse off, but benefit
those workers who retain their jobs
* Rent controls make some tenants better off at the expense of landlords
* *Market Efficiency* How does this effect society overall?

==== Demand as Value and Supply as Cost

* Price corresponding to a specific quantity demanded is the highest price
consumers are willing to pay
** As shown by the height of the demand curve

* Price corresponding to a specific quantity supplied is the lowest price
producers are willing to accept
** As show by the height of the supply curve

==== Reinterpreting the Demand Curve

image::images/ECON208Lecture-877b2.png[align=center]

* For each pizza the price on the demand curve shows the value consumers
receive from consuming that pizza

==== Reinterpreting the Supply Curve

* For each pizza, the price on the supply curve shows the additional costs to
firms of producing that pizza

==== Economic Surplus

* *Economic Surplus*: for any given quantity the area below the demand curve and
above the supply curve shows the economic surplus associated with the prodution
and consumption of that good
** Represents the net value that society as a whole earns by producing and
consuming that good

==== Market Inefficiency with Price Controls

.Price floor

* Change in CS=-(B + D)
* Change in PS=B-E
* Change in Total Surplus = -(D + E)

.price ceiling

* Change in CS=C-D
* Change in PS=-(C-E)
* Change in Total surplus = - (D+E)

.output quotas
image::images/ECON208Lecture-8c00d.png[]

* Change in CS = - (B+D)
* Change in PS = B - E
* Change in total surplus = - (D + E)
