= Jigsaw Read 2.0

* Build System: outlines how software is assembled from sources
* Build process: act of assembling a software system 4 steps
1. configuration, build tools are selected
2. construction, compiler and other commands that produce deliverables are executed
3. certification, automatically executing tests
4. packaging, step


== Low-level

* define build dependencies between input and output, as well as commands
that implement the input output transformation
* *Make*: automatically synchronized program sources and deliverables
** Specifications outline target-dependency-recipe tuples
** Targets specify files created by a recipe ie shell script that is executed
when target
1. does not exist
2. is older than one or more of its dependencies

* *phony targets* represent abstract phases of the build process rather than
concrete files
* *Ant*: Borrows the tuple concept from make, however all Ant targets are
abstract
** When ant target is triggered, a list of specified tasks are invoked that
execute in Java

* Rake, Jam, and SCons also use tuples, but allow maintainers to write

== Questions

1. what is a phony target/example?
2. what are the four steps of a build system
