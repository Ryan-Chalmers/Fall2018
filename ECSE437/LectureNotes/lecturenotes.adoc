== Overview

=== Reading: Modern Release Engineering in a Nutshell

* 6 major phases of a release pipeline

==== Integration Branching and Merging

* Movement of code changes made on development up to master
* A branch is made as a revision of some parent, has a record of chronicle
sequence of changes (commits) and is eventually merged back into the parent
* Quality assurance activities (code reviews) should be down before merge
* Branch merges can create merge conflicts of different types (text-level,
build-level, test-level, semantic level)
* Rules of thumb to mitigate merge conflicts
** Keep branch merges short-lived and merge often
** Rebase (synch up) with recent changes of the parent branch

* Trunk Based Development: eliminate branches, everyone works off master, thus
eliminating the problem of merge conflicts
* Feature Toggle: Allow the source code of incomplete features to be put inside
a conditional block that is controlled by means of a variable

==== Continuous Integration: Building and Testing

* CI: refers to the activity of
** Continuously polling the VCS for new commits and merges
** Checking these revisions out on dedicated build machines, compiling them
** Running an initial set of tests to check for regressions

* Allows for fast feedback to developer or team while info is fresh in their
mind
* Test stages obtain deliverables built by CI process from "artifact repository"
which is a file server that cant tag files with metadata

==== Build System

* Set of build specification files used by the CI infrastructure to generate
project deliverables from source code
* Consists of two layers
** Configuration Layer: used to select features to be compiled and included
in the resulting deliverables
** Construction: used to specify build tool invocations that generate deliverables
from source code

* Different type of build systems:
** File Level: Make
** Task Based: Ant
** Lifecycle Based: Maven
** High level: cmake

==== Infrastructure as Code

* Refers to server, cloud, container or virtual machine on which a new version
of the system should be deployed for testing or production
* Used to generate the right environment based on a specification developed
in a dedicated programming language
* Virtual machines: self contained systems containing and operating system, and
library or services required to emulate a server that can run the application
under development
* Container: lightweight alternative to a virtual machine
** Share as many components as possible in the form of images
** Save disk space and memory

==== Deployment

* Deployment is the phase in which the tested variables for the upcoming
release are staged in preparation for release
* Dark Launching: deploying new features without releasing them to the public
** The system automatically make calls to hidden features in a way invisible
to end users

* Blue/Green Deployment: deploys the next version on a copy of the production
environment, updates DNS to redirect traffic to new environment
* Canary Deployment: release of the software system is loaded to a subset of
the production environments
* A/B Testing: deploys alternative A of a feature to the environment of a
subset of the user base, while alternative B is released to another subset
** Check which is better

==== Release

* "Rolling Forward": rolling back a release is difficult, instead roll out
a new release to fix the problem

=== Release Pipelines

1. Integrate: VCS
2. Build
* 1. Configuration
* 2. Construction
* 3. Certification
* 4. Packaging
* 5. Deployment

3. Deploy
4. Monitor

== Version Control

=== Git: Distributed Version Control System

* Offline Accessibility:
** Centralized VCS clients need server connections for most operators
** By contrast most operations can be performed on the DVCS clients without
using the server

* Branch and Merge operations
** Branches in CVCSs must be created and merged on the server
** DVCS clients can create and merge branches as lightweight operations on their
client machines

==== Rebasing

* Rebase before merging, automatically rewinds your branch changes

image::images/lecturenotes-2e4e5.png[align=center]

* Reapply the changes to the new head of the target branch

* After rebasing, the merge option is trivial

==== Overview of Git Architecture

* Decentralized by design
** Each repository can act as a server or a client
** By convention, a server side only repository is typically a bare repository
named with the .git extension

* Git can be served over several protocols
** Local: fasted and most secure
** Git Protocol: slow and bad
** HTTPS and SSH: about same speed and security\

== Build Systems

=== Using C

* Have a group of uncompiled c code *.c
* Then need to compile all the c code: gcc -c *.c
* Then need to link all the dependencies to make program gcc *.o -o program_name
* When we fix a bug in one of the source code files the file must be
rebuilt and then everything thing that depends on it must also be rebuilt
* Tedious

=== Reading: A Large-Scale Empirical Study of the Relationship between Build Technology and Maintenance

* Build System: refers to specification that outline how a software system is
assembled from its sources
* Build Process: the act of assembling a software system, consists of 4 steps
** Configuration step: a set of build tools and features are selected
** Construction step: compiler and other commands that produce deliverables are
executed in an order to satisfy dependencies
** Certification step: automatically execute tests to ensure that produces
deliverables have not regressed
** Packaging step: bundles certified deliverables together with required
libraries, documentation and data files

==== Low-Level

* Explicitly define build dependencies between input and output files, as well
as the commands that implement the input-output transformation
* Make: targets specify build files created by a recipe, i.e. a shell script
that is executed when target either does not exist or is older than one
of its dependencies
* Phony Target: represents abstract phases of a build process rather than
concrete files in a filesystem

==== Abstraction Based

* Maintainers have to constantly repeat low-level expressions to account for
variability in platform, abstraction fixes this
* Automatically generate low-level specifications based on higher level
abstractions

==== Framework driven

* Framework-driven technologies favor build convention over configuration
* Maven

==== Dependency Management

* Augment build systems by managing external dependencies, making sure the local
cache contains all APIs necessary to build the project
* Offer two advantages
1. users no longer need to carefully install required versions of libraries
manually
2. production and development environments can coexist, since the potentially
unstable versions of libraries that are required for development are placed
in the local cache that is quarantined from the running system

=== Low Level Build Systems

==== Make

1. Expressing Dependencies
** Program
*** random.o , input.o, main.o
**** random.c, input.c main.c

2. Writing Recipes
----
program : random.o input.o main.o
  gcc -o program random.o input.o main.o

random.o : random.c
  gcc -c random.c

my_command="gcc -c input.c"
input.o : input.c
  $(my_command)

main.o : main.c ; gcc -c main.c

.PHONY: clean
clean:
  rm -f random.o input.o main.o program
----

* Equivalent to above *Good to know, Midterm*
----
program: random.o input.o main.o
  gcc -c $@ $^
%.o
  gcc -c $<

.PHONY: clean
clean:
  rm -f random.o input.o main.o program
----

===== How does make work?

image::images/lecturenotes-c7fca.png[align=center]

===== Shortcomings with low-level build tools like make

* Platform specific scripts: not portable, repeated lines
* Recursion based build design is harmful
** to handle dependencies across directories, recursive calls to make are used,
this fractures the global dependency graph

=== Abstraction Based Build Systems

* Addresses shortcomings of low-level specs

* GNU Autotools
** Expands macros to generate platform specific Makefiles and production code

* CMake:
** A toolchain that again expands higher level abstractions to generate lower
level build specs
** Generates Makefiles, MVS and xcode files
** Exercise Using CMAKE from lecture: *Lab Tutorial*


=== Framework Driven Build System

==== Maven

* Maven Build Process
** Maven assumes that a build job follows a lifecycle
** A lifecycle is a sequential series of phases
** A phase performs a series of goals that are bound via plugins

* Maven build lifecycles
** Default: produces the project deliverables
** Clean: undoes build commands to return the project to its initial state
** Site: generates the project website materials

image::images/lecturenotes-fb9af.png[align=center]

===== Goal Binding for Maven Lifecycles

* Phase to goal bindings
** What is performed during a phase depends on the goals that are bound to it,
and the plugins that are associated with those goals
** A phase with no goals or plugins is a noop

* The bindings depend on the deliverable
** The deliverable is what maven is tasked with producing
** The goals that are bound to lifecycle phases by default depend on the
deliverable that we are trying to produce

=== Dependency Management Tools

* Internal dependencies become easier to track
* Projects are becoming more and more connected
* Maven manages repositories of dependencies on your machine
* Maven Central: an online resource where packages are published and made
available to Maven users

==== Maven as an External Dependency tool

* Dependency resolution:
** Dependencies are expressed in the pom.xml file
** If an appropriate version of a dependency is not available in your local repo,
it is downloaded from maven central

* Dependency Scope:
** Dependencies can be bound to specific phases, scoping their impact down to
those users who run those phases

== Routine Builds and Continuous Integration

=== Build system Interactions

==== Developers

* Developers execute personal builds on their development machines to:
** Synch their changes into deliverables so that they can perform basic tests
** Ensure that their changes have not introduced build problems

==== Quality Assurance

* QA teams hook automated tests into the build system
* Since normal builds should proved quick feedback only quick tests are run
by defaults
* Slower test can be relegated to special build targets

==== Release Engineers

* Release engineers are concerned with micro and macro aspects of build systems
** Micro-build: concerns about the behavior of a build system within a single
execution
** Macro-build: concerns about how to best provision a fleet of build resources

==== Static Analysis

* Static analysis tools listen to commands that are executed by the build system
* Use executed commands to put together a graph of how source code files are
connected
* Scan the graph for common bugs like resource leaks and dead code

==== Code Review Environments

* Teams that use modern code review tools like Gerrit connect build hobs to
the code reviewing dashboards

==== Nightly Builds

* At night, a build is executed to produce deliverables that include the changes
of the prior day
* QA teams can pick up those deliverables in the morning to test the new feature
and verify bug fixes
* Issues:
** As the amount of change per day has grown, nightly builds have become
difficult
** If there is build commits on the build then it is hard to tell which commit
caused the break

* Solution: run frequent smaller builds

=== Continuous Builds

.Continuous Integration Feedback loop
image::images/lecturenotes-17154.png[align=center]

* Each push gets its own build job
* CI simplifies problem assignment: problems correspond to a logical set of
changes made by one developer
* CI simplifies problem analysis: reports errors quickly

=== Reading: Modern CI Process

==== Build Triggering Events

* Cycle begins with build triggering event
* Builds are triggered:
** During development
** When the code is submitted for review
** The change is integrated into the project VCS

==== Build Job Creation Service

* When a build triggering event occurs, a build job creations node will add
a job to the queue of pending build jobs

==== Build Job Processing Service

* build jobs in the pending queue will be allocated to a build job processing
node
* The job processing node will first download the latest version of the source
code and apply the change under consideration
* Next the job processing node will initiate the build process, which will
compile the system if necessary, execute a system of automated tests, and make
the system available for users

==== Build Job Reporting Service

* build jobs results in the reporting queue will be communicated to the
development team
* Reporting preferences can be configured such that particular receipts receive
notifications when builds are successful

=== Keeping Build Systems Robust

* Build systems need maintenance
** As source code changes, occasionally the build system will need to be updated
** Neglected build maintenance makes the build process produce incorrect
results

=== Test Flakiness

* Flaky Tests: a test with non-deterministic behavior
* False positives: test code has a failed test when the code is actually fine
* False negatives: test passes when it should have failed

image::images/lecturenotes-17154.png[align=center]

== Code Inspections and Code Review

* Use knowledge of the system, its domain and the technologies used to discover
problems

=== Software inspections and Review: Advantages over dynamic V&V

* Cascading errors can obfuscate test results: Once an error occurs, later
errors may be new, or are the cascading effect of prior error
* Incomplete versions can be inspected: tests require an executable version of
the system, while inspections do not
* Good inspections are more than "Bug Hunts"
** Inspection uncover inefficiencies and style issues
** Inspection are a form of knowledge sharing and collaborative problem solving

=== Structured Inspections

* Rigid heavyweight process
* Involve in-person meetings, review checklists

* Roles
** Moderator
** Scribe
** Reviewer
** Reader
** Producer

=== Tips for a Productive Code Review

[options="header"]
|==================
|Do: | Dont:
| Critique the artifact | Attack the person
| Keep review chunks short and succinct | submit fixes for multiple issues at the same time
| Plan time for review | skip reviews
| Prioritize review of important issues | FIFO queue reviews
| Keep things light | Use sarcasm or exaggerations
|==================

=== Code Review Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of critiquing code by doing it and helping others
to do it. Trough this work we have come to value +
Constructive Feedback _over_ Ad hominem attacks +
Clearly articulated rationale _over_ strongly worded opinion +
Suggested means for improvement _over_ only focussing on the criticism +

=== Modern Reviews

==== Reading: Why do programmers do code reviews?

===== Finding Defects

The top listed reason for doing code reviews. Both low-level (correct logic is
  in place) and high-level (catch errors in design).

===== Code Improvement

Comments or changes in the code in terms of reliability, commenting, consistency,
dead code removal , etc but do not involve correctness or defects.

===== Alternative Solutions

Regard changes and comments on improving submitted code by adopting an idea
that leads to a better implementation.

===== Knowledge Transfer

One of the main purposes for a code review is distribution of knowledge, if you
did not learn anything from a code review then it wasn't a very good review.

===== Team Awareness and Transparency

Code reviews act as a signaling mechanism to notify other devs that there are
changes being made in the the code base and that if they would like, they can
observe these changes.

===== Share code ownership

Breaks the idea that each person owns their code and instead code was writte
so the team can progress as a whole.

==== Roles

* Author
* Reviewer
* Integrator
* Verifier
