== Modern Release in a Nutshell

=== Build System

* set of build specification files
* automates testing and deployment
* configuration layer
** selects features to be configured and compiled
** selects build tools necessary to complete

* Construction layer
** specifies build tool invocations required to generate deliverables
** build tools are order dependent, this layer orders

* Many build systems exist all for different languages and paradigms
** Make: file based
** Ant: task based
** Maven
*** Lifecycle based: build system of a project has a sequence of standard build
activities that together form the build lifecycle

* CMAKE
** Build system generator

=== Infrastructure as Code

* infrastructure refers to environment
* previously system operators had to configure each vm individually
* IaC is used to automatically generate the right environment based on the
specification developed in a dedicated language

* VMs form the backbone of cloud environments because of their modularity
* Containers
** lightweight alternative to vm
** save space over vms by sharing components across images
** save disk, memory space and runtime overhead

* store infrastructure in different vcs to to restrict access

== Questions

* Describe a file based build system (ie. Make)
* What is a container and what are its benefits over a VM?
* What is trunk-based development and how does it reduce the burden of branches
merges and conflicts
* *Midterm Qs*
